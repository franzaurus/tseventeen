## About
Tseventeen block is a re-creation of the Twenty Seventeen classic theme as a block theme, using TT3's default style as the baseline. This theme is built entirely in the Site Editor with a very minimal custom CSS. This means the theme is constructed entirely without code.

## How to use the theme
1. Install and activate **tseventeen-block** theme
2. Create a page that will act as your homepage (e.g., Home).
3. Insert a Landing Page pattern from the Featured category into the page.
4. Assign the Front Page template to the page.
5. Create a blog page that will serve as your blog's home.
6. Assign the Blog Home template to this page.
7. Set both the homepage and the blog home page as static pages under the Reading options.
